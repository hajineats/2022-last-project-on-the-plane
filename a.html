    <div>
        I tasked myself to code on the plane.
        <div>
            Then I got distracted by the breakfast
        </div>
        <div>
            Then I got distracted by two movies
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        And I could not help getting a shin ramen on the plane
        <div>
            Because it was free
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        While watching movie I also got a pretzel
        <div>
            and it tasted delicious
            <div>
                I like non-salty pretzels
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        Then when I started coding, my brother said
        <div>
            "you just wanna look cool on the plane don't you"
            <div>
                and I nodded
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        and to anyone reading this code
        <div>
            sorry I am a backend developer
        </div>
    </div>
